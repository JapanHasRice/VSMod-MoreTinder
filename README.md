Ever wish you could construct a firepit with more than just firewood (or bamboo)? Now you can!... sort of. Placing a piece of dry grass on the ground now instantly creates a constructed firepit, no need to load up 4 logs.

The firepit will keep its old behavior when placing it on top of firewood piles. You will still need 4 firewood (or bamboo) to create a charcoal pit.
